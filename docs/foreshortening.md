If the field of view is 90Â°, then the canvas 1 m away would be 2 m wide,
something one meter off to the side would be on the edge of the frame

2 m away, something 1 m off to the side would be halfway to the edge of the frame,
0.5, 1 / 2

to get the factor to multiply that against, divide the fov by 90
